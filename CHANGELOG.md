# Changelog

All notable changes to ZX-M8XXX are documented in this file.

## v0.9.27
- **Port Trace Filter**: Whitelist filter for trace logging and Port I/O log
  - When empty, all ports are traced (default behavior); when ports are specified, only matching ports are recorded
  - Applies to both runtime trace port ops and standalone Port I/O log
  - Mask-based matching using same `parsePortSpec` format as breakpoints: `FE`, `7FFD`, `FE&FF`
  - UI: Port filter row in Trace panel with add/remove/clear controls and filter list
  - Filter state (`portTraceFilters`) persisted in project save/load
- **Fix**: Port I/O Export button no longer opens save dialog twice
- **Multi-Drive Support**: BetaDisk 4 drives (A-D) + FDC 2 drives (A-B) + simultaneous tape
  - **BetaDisk per-drive state** (`loaders.js`): `drives[]` array with per-drive `diskData`, `diskType`, and `headTrack`
    - WD1793 track register remains shared (real hardware behavior); physical head position tracked per drive
    - `loadDisk(data, type, driveIndex)` — load into specific drive
    - `ejectDisk(driveIndex)` / `hasDisk(driveIndex)` / `hasAnyDisk()` — per-drive management
    - `createBlankDisk(label, driveIndex)` — blank formatted disk in specific drive
  - **FDC per-drive updates** (`fdc.js`): `ejectDisk(driveIndex)`, drive number in activity callback
  - **Tape + Disk coexistence** (`spectrum.js`): Loading tape no longer ejects disk and vice versa
    - Separate state: `loadedTape`, `loadedBetaDisks[4]`, `loadedFDCDisks[2]`
    - Separate file listings per controller: `loadedBetaDiskFiles[4]`, `loadedFDCDiskFiles[2]`
    - `clearTape()` / `clearDisk(driveIndex, type)` for selective clearing
  - **Drive selector UI** (`index.html`): Dropdown to choose target drive (A-D) when loading disk images
  - **Per-drive catalog tabs**: Dynamic drive sub-tabs in Settings → Media disk catalog
    - Simple labels (`A:`, `B:`, etc.) when one controller is active
    - Prefixed labels (`3DOS:A`, `3DOS:B`, `TRD:A`, `TRD:B`) when both FDC and Beta Disk have disks simultaneously
    - Each tab shows only its controller's catalog content
  - **Disk activity indicator**: Drive letter prefix (e.g., `A:T00:S01:A`), tooltip lists all loaded drives
  - **Auto-load gating**: Only triggers when loading into drive A (index 0)
  - **Project save/load v2**: `mediaVersion: 2` format stores tape + per-drive Beta Disk + per-drive FDC disk
    - Backward compatible with old single-media project format

## v0.9.26
- **Scorpion ZS 256 Support**: New machine type — Soviet clone with 256KB RAM
  - New "scorpion" option in machine selector dropdown (group: Scorpion)
  - 256KB RAM (16 × 16KB pages), 4 ROM banks in `scorpion.rom` (64KB)
  - ROM layout: ROM0=128 BASIC, ROM1=48 BASIC, ROM2=Service Monitor, ROM3=TR-DOS
  - Pentagon-compatible ULA timing (224 T/line × 320 lines = 71680 T/frame, no contention)
  - AY clock: 1.75 MHz (Pentagon standard)
  - Port 0x7FFD: standard 128K paging (RAM pages 0-7, ROM 0/1, screen bank, paging lock)
  - Port 0x1FFD (exact match): bit 0 = RAM page 0 over ROM, bit 1 = Service Monitor ROM select, bit 4 = RAM page high bit (+8)
  - 3-way ROM selection (per FUSE): 1FFD bit 1 set → ROM 2 (Service Monitor); unset → 7FFD bit 4 selects ROM 0/1
  - Built-in TR-DOS: ROM bank 3 loaded into Beta Disk ROMCS (`trdosInRom: true`) — no separate `trdos.rom` required
  - Beta Disk interface enabled by default (same as Pentagon)
  - SZX machine ID: 8, Z80 hardware mode: 9 (same as Pentagon)
  - SZX snapshots save/load all 16 RAM pages + port 0x1FFD state
  - SNA load preserves Scorpion machine type when already selected
  - Auto-loads from `roms/scorpion.rom` on startup
  - ROM dialog with scorpion.rom button and status indicator
- **Test runner: Scorpion and Pentagon 1024 support**: Both machines now available as test targets
  - Added `scorpion` and `pentagon1024` to test runner `switchMachine()` mapping
  - Previously fell through to 48K default silently
- **Fix SZX snapshot Pentagon 1024**: Save/load now preserves full paging state
  - Port 0x7FFD reconstruction includes extended bits 6-7 (RAM bank bits 3-4) and bit 5 (1MB mode)
  - Port 0xEFF7 saved in SPCR byte 3 and restored on load
  - RAM page count no longer capped at 16 — all 64 pages saved/loaded correctly
- **Fix SZX snapshot +3 paging**: Port 0x1FFD now restored for +3 (not just +2A)
  - Changed `machineType === '+2a'` check to `pagingModel === '+2a'` which covers both +2A and +3
- **Fix SNA load Pentagon 1024**: Machine type preserved when loading 128K SNA snapshots
  - Previously dropped to generic 128K; now stays on Pentagon 1024 (same as Pentagon and Scorpion)
- **Fix getFullState() Pentagon 1024**: State dump now includes portEFF7, pentagon1024Mode, and ramInRomMode
- **Extract shared constants** (`constants.js`): Magic numbers replaced with named constants
  - Port addresses: `PORT_7FFD`, `PORT_1FFD`, `PORT_EFF7`, `PORT_ULAPLUS_*`, `PORT_WD_*`
  - Port decode masks: `DECODE_128K_MASK`, `DECODE_PLUS2A_MASK`, `DECODE_AY_MASK`, etc.
  - Paging bit masks: `P7FFD_RAM_MASK`, `P7FFD_SCREEN_BIT`, `P7FFD_ROM_BIT`, `P7FFD_LOCK_BIT`
  - SNA format sizes: `SNA_48K_SIZE`, `SNA_128K_SIZE`, `SNA_128K_MIN`, `PAGE_SIZE`
  - Screen memory: `SCREEN_ATTR`, `SCREEN_END`, `BANK_MASK`

## v0.9.25
- **Explorer: DSK file support**: Tools → Explorer now parses and displays DSK disk images
  - Shows disk geometry (format, tracks, sides, sectors, block size, reserved tracks)
  - +3DOS boot sector parsing: reads disk specification with checksum validation
  - CP/M directory listing with precise file sizes from +3DOS headers
  - File types (BASIC/CODE) with load addresses and autostart line numbers
  - Full filenames with extensions (e.g. `SCREEN.BIN`, `GAME.CODE`)
  - BASIC program decoding: click a BASIC file to see decoded listing
  - Boot sector disassembly: Disasm tab shows boot loader code at $FE10
  - Boot sector hex dump: Hex tab shows full boot sector from $FE00
  - File content access: click a file for hex dump or disassembly
  - Screen preview for files matching known screen sizes (6912, 6144, etc.)
  - DSK files accessible inside ZIP archives (auto-drill and click)
- **Fix**: DSK Explorer crash on non-standard disk formats ("source array is too long")
  - Disks with large sectors (e.g. 4096 bytes) caused fractional `sectorsPerBlock`, leading to undersized buffer in `_readDirectory` and overflow in `TypedArray.set()`
  - `_readDirectory` rewritten to use byte-count loop, handles any sector size
  - `listFiles`/`readFileData` now use boot track geometry consistently for block-to-sector mapping
- **Fix**: DSK loading crash on non-CP/M disks (e.g. copy-protected games like Hostages)
  - `listFiles()` wrapped in try/catch in both `loadDSKImage()` and Explorer
  - Non-filesystem disks load and auto-boot correctly; Explorer shows geometry without file list

## v0.9.24
- **FDC Read Track command (0x02)**: Implement Read Track for copy-protected games (e.g. Batman)
  - Reads all sectors on current track in physical order, ignoring sector IDs
  - Previously unrecognized command caused FDC desync — game sent 9-byte command but FDC returned invalid result after byte 1, leaving subsequent bytes misinterpreted
- **FDC Scan commands (0x11/0x19/0x1D)**: Accept all 9 command bytes (stub returning scan-not-satisfied)
  - Prevents same desync issue as Read Track for any game using Scan Equal/Low/High
- **Fix FDC drive select masking**: Only bit 0 decoded on +3 hardware (drives 0/2 map to same physical drive)
  - Batman's bootstrap uses drive=2 in FDC commands; previously treated as non-existent drive
- **Fix FDC Read/Write Data physical track lookup**: Use drive head position, not logical cylinder from command
  - Copy-protected disks have non-matching physical/logical track numbers (e.g. physical track 38, C=0x12 in sector headers)
  - Previously read data from wrong physical tracks, causing garbage on screen
- **Fix FDC Read Data R > EOT handling**: Always read at least sector R regardless of EOT value
  - On real µPD765, sector R is always read; EOT only controls when to stop reading additional sectors
  - Games with non-standard sector layouts (R=0x0B, EOT=0x09) hung waiting for data that was never provided
- **Fix FDC CRC-error noise destroying game data**: Only randomize CRC-error sectors where stored data fully covers the declared size
  - Oversized sectors (e.g. N=6, 8192 declared, 6144 actual) have CRC errors because declared size exceeds stored data — their content is valid game data, not noise
  - Previously ALL CRC-error sectors had bytes 256+ randomized, destroying valid data (e.g. Robocop 2)
  - Now: `sec.data.length >= sectorDataSize` → randomize (genuine CRC corruption, e.g. Target Renegade protection); `sec.data.length < sectorDataSize` → pass through as-is
- **Fix +3 DSK auto-load**: Use Amstrad menu Enter key injection (like +2/+2A tape) instead of raw PC=0 boot — ROM's "Loader" option now properly detects disk and boots the game

## v0.9.23
- **ZX Spectrum +3 Support**: First-class machine type with built-in floppy disk controller
  - New "+3" option in machine selector dropdown
  - +3 ROM section in ROM dialog (`plus3.rom`, 64KB — 4 ROM banks)
  - Auto-loads from `roms/plus3.rom` on startup
  - Same memory banking as +2A (`pagingModel: '+2a'`, port 0x1FFD special paging)
  - Z80 snapshot hwMode 7 maps to +3; SZX machineId 5 maps to +3
  - `is128kCompat()` helper updated to include +3
- **µPD765 FDC Emulation** (`fdc.js`): Floppy disk controller for ZX Spectrum +3
  - Full state machine: idle → command → execution → result phases
  - 11 commands: Specify, Sense Drive Status, Read/Write Data, Recalibrate, Sense Interrupt Status, Read ID, Write/Read Deleted Data, Format Track, Seek
  - MSR (Main Status Register) with RQM, DIO, NDMA, CB bits
  - Port 0x2FFD (MSR read), 0x3FFD (data read/write), motor via 0x1FFD bit 3
  - 4 drives supported, instant-completion model (same approach as BetaDisk WD1793)
  - Disk activity indicator shows FDC operations
- **DSK Disk Format Support**: Standard and extended CPC DSK format
  - `DSKLoader.parse()` handles both "MV - CPC" standard and "EXTENDED CPC DSK" formats
  - `DSKImage` class for in-memory disk with read/write sector operations
  - CP/M-style directory listing in Settings → Media → Disk tab
  - `.dsk` files recognized in file picker, ZIP browser, and drag-and-drop
- **Auto Load for +3 DSK**: Boots +3 from disk automatically when Auto Load is enabled
  - `bootPlus3Disk()` resets machine, preserves disk, sets motor on, boots from ROM
  - Amstrad menu handling: +3 added to Amstrad menu detection
- **Fix**: Beta Disk auto-paging on +2A used hardcoded ROM bank 1
  - `updateBetaDiskPaging()` and `bootTrdos()` now use `profile.basicRomBank` (bank 3 for +2A)
- **Fix**: FDC port reads (0x2FFD, 0x3FFD) were overwritten by floating bus handler
  - FDC reads were outside the port dispatch if/else chain; floating bus `else` clause overwrote results with garbage
  - Moved FDC reads into the if/else chain to prevent fallthrough
- **Fix**: FDC Read/Write Data correctly buffers sectors from R to EOT
  - +3 ROM sets EOT=R for single-sector reads (buffers 1 sector), custom game loaders set EOT > R for multi-sector reads
  - Previously single-sector-only buffering broke custom loaders that expect multi-sector transfers (e.g. Venom Strikes Back, Target Renegade)
- **Fix**: FDC data commands returned normal termination (ST0=0x00) instead of abnormal
  - +3 ROM expects ST0 bits 7:6 = 01 (abnormal) and ST1 bit 7 = EN (end of track) because TC is never asserted
  - Without these flags, +3DOS treated successful reads as errors
- **Fix**: FDC MSR missing drive busy bits and EXM flag
  - Added drive busy bits (MSR bits 0-3), set by Seek/Recalibrate, cleared by Sense Interrupt Status
  - EXM bit (bit 5) correctly set during execution phase for non-DMA mode
- **Fix**: FDC Sense Drive Status returned wrong flags for missing drives
  - No disk now returns WP=1 (write protected) + RDY=0 (not ready), matching +3 ROM's drive detection logic
- **Fix**: FDC CM (Control Mark) flag in ST2 was inverted for Read Deleted Data
  - CM should be set when actual data mark type doesn't match command expectation
  - Read Data + deleted mark → CM=1; Read Deleted Data + normal mark → CM=1
- **Fix**: Extended DSK parser returned empty sector data when `actualLen=0`
  - In extended CPC DSK format, `actualLen=0` means use default size from N (size code), not 0 bytes
  - Affected games using non-standard formats (e.g. Target Renegade: 1024-byte sectors, deleted data marks)
- **Fix**: FDC Read Data/Read Deleted Data discarded DSK sector error flags (ST1/ST2)
  - DSK files store per-sector ST1/ST2 for copy protection (CRC errors, missing marks, etc.)
  - FDC now passes through DSK error flags (DE, DD, MA, MD) merged with computed flags (EN, CM)
  - Fixes copy-protected games that check for specific error signatures (e.g. Target Renegade reads sector 2 expecting ST1=0x20 DE + ST2=0x20 DD)
- **Fix**: EDSK weak/random sector support for copy protection (Speedlock +3)
  - Sectors with `actualSize > nominalSize` (exact multiple) contain multiple data copies
  - At parse time, copies are compared byte-by-byte to build a weak byte map
  - On each FDC read, weak byte positions are randomized (FUSE approach)
  - Fixes Speedlock-protected games that read a sector multiple times and expect different data (e.g. Target Renegade)
- **Fix**: FDC SK (Skip Deleted) flag parsed but never used in Read Data/Read Deleted Data
  - SK=1 now skips sectors whose mark type doesn't match the command
  - SK=0 reads mismatched sectors but sets CM flag and terminates after the sector
  - Per-sector DDAM check via DSK ST2 bit 6 (Deleted Data Address Mark indicator)
- **Fix**: FDC EN (End of Track) flag unconditionally set in ST1
  - EN should only be set when all R→EOT sectors were read without early termination
  - Not set when terminated by CM (mark mismatch) or CRC error (DE flag)
- **Fix**: +2A/+3 memory contention used wrong delay pattern
  - 48K/128K/+2 use pattern (6,5,4,3,2,1,0,0); +2A/+3 use (7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0)
  - Added profile-driven `contentionPattern` property (`'65432100'` vs `'76543210'`)
  - Precomputed contention delay lookup table replaces Swan formula
  - Reference: FUSE `contend_delay_76543210` for +3, sinclair.wiki.zxnet.co.uk contention tables
- **Fix**: +2A/+3 incorrectly applied IO contention
  - The Amstrad 40077 gate array only contends on MREQ, not during IO operations
  - Added `hasIOContention` profile flag; `applyIOTimings` returns 0 when false
  - Reference: sinclair.wiki.zxnet.co.uk/wiki/Contended_I/O ("no contention occurs" on +3)
- **Fix**: +2A/+3 incorrectly applied internal cycle contention
  - Non-MREQ cycles (DJNZ, JR internal waits) should not be contended on +2A/+3
  - Added `hasInternalContention` profile flag; `contendInternal` skips delays when false
  - Reference: FUSE `contend_delay_no_mreq = spectrum_contend_delay_none` for +3

## v0.9.22
- **Machine Profile System**: Configurable machine definitions replacing hardcoded type checks

  - Port 0x1FFD handling: special all-RAM paging modes (4 configurations)
  - ROM bank selection via combined 0x7FFD bit 4 and 0x1FFD bit 2
  - +2A contention: banks 4,5,6,7 (differs from 128K/+2 which uses 1,3,5,7)
  - Same ULA timing as 128K (228 T/line, 311 lines, 70908 T/frame)
  - Z80 snapshot hwMode 13 maps to +2A; SZX machineId 4 maps to +2A
  - SZX snapshot preserves port 0x1FFD value in SPCR chunk
  - +3/+3e SZX snapshots treated as +2A (hardware-identical minus floppy)
  - Tape trap uses ROM bank 3 for 48K BASIC (not bank 1 like 128K)
  - `is128kCompat()` helper updated to include +2A
- **Auto Load for Amstrad menu** (+2/+2A): Press Enter to select "Tape Loader" (default menu item) which runs LOAD "" automatically — no key typing needed
- **SCL boot injection**: Boot file injection (Settings → Media → Boot File) now works for SCL files
  - SCL converted to TRD format before boot injection via `betaDisk.sclToTrd()`
  - Ensures "Add boot" / "Replace boot" modes apply to both TRD and SCL disk images
- **Test runner +2A support**: Test suite correctly loads TAP files on +2A machines
  - Mirrors main auto-load approach: waits for Amstrad menu, presses Enter for Tape Loader
  - Machine alias `plus2a` mapped to `+2a` in test runner's `switchMachine()`
- **Test runner TRD/SCL disk support**: Tests can now boot from disk images
  - New `diskRun` field in tests.json: program name to run (e.g. `"game"`) or `"boot"` for boot file
  - Boots TR-DOS via `bootTrdos()`, waits for prompt, types `RUN "filename"` and Enter
  - Works with TRD and SCL files (SCL converted to TRD automatically)

## v0.9.20
- **ZX Spectrum +2 Support**: First-class machine type with dedicated ROM
  - New "+2" option in machine selector dropdown
  - +2 ROM section in ROM dialog (`plus2.rom`, 32KB)
  - Auto-loads from `roms/plus2.rom` on startup
  - ROM dialog reopens with Close button when switching to a machine with missing ROM
  - Identical hardware to 128K (same ULA timing, contention, AY, memory banking) — only ROM differs
  - `is128kCompat()` helper function for 128K-compatible hardware checks
  - Z80 snapshot hwMode 12 maps to +2; SZX machineId 3 maps to +2
  - Z80/SZX export writes correct machine identifiers for +2
  - SNA load preserves +2 machine type when already selected
  - Tape trap ROM bank check includes +2

## v0.9.19
- **Auto Load**: Automatic load-and-run for tape and disk files
  - New "Auto Load" checkbox in Settings → Media (enabled by default)
  - TAP/TZX: Resets machine, types `LOAD ""` (128K: selects BASIC from menu first)
  - TRD/SCL: Boots into TR-DOS automatically
  - Pure turbo TZX (no standard blocks): Switches to real-time mode automatically
  - setTimeout-based key injection using `ula.keyDown()`/`ula.keyUp()`
  - Cancels cleanly on machine change, reset, or new file load
  - Setting saved/restored in project files
- **TZX Turbo Block Handoff**: Flash load to real-time turbo transition
  - Dual tape system: `tapeLoader` (standard blocks only) + `tapePlayer` (all blocks)
  - `standardBlockMap` maps flash-loaded block indices to full tape positions
  - After flash-loading standard blocks, turbo blocks auto-start via `_turboBlockPending` flag
  - Auto-start triggers in `portRead()` when custom loader reads port 0xFE
  - Critical `PC >= 0x4000` guard prevents false trigger from ROM keyboard scan
- **Tape Block Catalog**: Block listing in Settings → Media
  - Shows all TZX/TAP blocks with type labels (Standard, Turbo, Pure Tone, etc.)
  - Displays block sizes and current playback position
- **Fix**: Disk auto-load (TRD/SCL) crashed on Pentagon instead of booting TR-DOS
  - `bootTrdos()` was manually constructing system variables and jumping to wrong entry point (0x3D13)
  - Rewritten to use FUSE-style approach: reset machine, select ROM bank 1, page in TR-DOS ROM, boot from address 0
  - TR-DOS ROM runs its own initialization from address 0, properly setting up all system variables and workspace
- **Fix**: Beta Disk auto-paging only worked on Pentagon, not on 48K/128K with Beta Disk enabled
  - Main loop gated `updateBetaDiskPaging()` by `isPentagon` instead of `_betaDiskPagingEnabled`
- **Fix**: Loading TRD/SCL on machine without Beta Disk no longer forces switch to Pentagon
  - Now shows warning message instead of automatically changing machine type

## v0.9.18
- **Fix**: Screen flicker in double-buffered games (e.g., Cubix) on 128K/Pentagon
  - Deferred paper rendering was incorrectly triggered by simple double-buffering (1 bank swap per frame)
  - Deferred mode reads screen RAM at end-of-frame, which shows the cleared back buffer instead of the completed display
  - Now only defers for scroll17-style effects (many rapid bank alternations per frame)
  - Normal scanline rendering correctly handles double-buffering by reading the active bank at each line's execution time
- **Fix**: SZX snapshots inside ZIP archives were not recognized
  - `findAllSpectrum()` in ZIP loader was missing `.szx` from the supported extension list
- **Fix**: SZX save wrote wrong machine ID for Pentagon (saved as 128K instead of Pentagon)
  - Caused machine type mismatch on load, leading to ULA dimension errors (IndexSizeError)
  - Pentagon machine ID is now correctly written as 7 in SZX header

## v0.9.17
- **Fix**: Debugger "Go to address" navigation error (navHistory not defined)
- **Fix**: Beam mode rendering improvements for multicolor programs after snapshot load
- **Fix**: Beam mode now preserves last complete frame as background (not overwritten when stepping)
- **Fix**: "No Bitmap" overlay mode now respects multicolor (per-scanline attributes)
- **Improve**: Beam mode previous frame is darker (50%) for better contrast with current colored region

## v0.9.16

- **RZX Playback Fix**: Fixed RZX playback failing when loaded from different machine type
  - Loading 48K RZX while in Pentagon or 128K mode now works correctly
  - ROM is now properly reloaded when machine type changes during snapshot loading
  - Previously, wrong ROM was used causing execution to diverge (e.g., RET returning to wrong address)

    - Tracks palette writes with T-state timing
    - Group-based palette lookup (12 groups × 64 entries per frame)
    - Works on 48K, 128K, and Pentagon machines
  - ULAplus state properly managed on machine switch (checkbox preserved, palette reset)
- **SCR Export with ULAplus**: Export screen with extended palette
  - Standard SCR: 6912 bytes (bitmap + attributes)
  - ULAplus SCR: 6976 bytes (+ 64-byte palette appended)
  - Auto-detects if game has modified ULAplus palette
  - Compatible with ZX-Paintbrush and other editors
- **Export Improvements**:
  - Added PNG format to export format selector
  - Export button uses selected format (PNG, SCR, BSC, etc.)
  - SCR export reads raw screen memory for accurate ULAplus data
- **Game Browser Improvements**:
  - Fixed pagination (client-side, fetches up to 100 results)
  - Added placeholder with diagonal lines for games without screenshots
  - Scroll to top when changing pages

## v0.9.13
- **Game Browser**: Added online game search powered by Spectrum Computing (ZXDB)
  - Access via Load → Web in toolbar
  - Search games by title with screenshots and details
  - Uses ZXInfo API (api.zxinfo.dk) - the largest ZX Spectrum database
  - Direct download links for TAP, TZX, Z80, SNA files
